        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. 
            Python is designed to be highly readable.</p>
            <li>Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. 
                This is similar to PERL and PHP.</li>
            <li>Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</li>
            <li>Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.</li>

    <div id="variables">
        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <p>Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. 
            This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.</p>
        <p>Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. 
            Therefore, by assigning different data types to variables, you can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.</p>
            <h3>How to assign variables</h3>
            <p>Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable. 
                The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.</p>
            <p>The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of the = operator is the value stored in the variable. 
                For example −</p>
                <li>x=2 where x is the variable name and 2 is the value</li>
    
        </div>
    <div id="data_types">
        <h2>Data Types</h2>
        <p>The data stored in memory can be of many types. 
            For example, a person's age is stored as a numeric value and his or her address is stored as alphanumeric characters. 
            Python has various standard data types that are used to define the operations possible on them and the storage method for each of them.</p>
            <p>Python has five standard data types</p>
            <li>Numbers</li>
            <li>Strings</li>
            <li>Lists</li>
            <li>Tuple</li>
            <li>Dictionary</li>
    </div>
    <div id="functions">
        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <p>A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. 
            Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.</p>
        <p>As you already know, Python gives you many built-in functions like print(), etc. but you can also create your own functions. 
            These functions are called user-defined functions.</p>
            <h3>Defining a function</h3>
            <p>You can define functions to provide the required functionality. Here are simple rules to define a function in Python.</p>
            <li>Function blocks begin with the keyword def followed by the function name and parentheses ( ( ) ).</li>
            <li>Any input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.</li>
            <li>The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented</li>
            <li>The statement return [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. 
                A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.</li>
                <h3>Syntax</h3>
                <p>def functionname( parameters ):<br>
                        "function_docstring"<br>
                        function_suite<br>
                        return [expression]</p>
